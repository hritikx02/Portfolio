            <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p><br><br>Hello! I'm Hritik Chaudhary, a passionate and driven third-year Computer Science student at RV
                Institute
                of Technology and Management, Bengaluru. With a strong foundation in Java, Python, HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, Django, Node.js, and more, I strive to create innovative, efficient, and user-friendly
                applications. <br><br></p>
            <div class="btn" id="read-more" onclick="onClickRead(this)">Read More</div>

            <div id="active-rm">
                <div class="p-rm">
                    <p>I have hands-on experience working on various projects such as OTC Drug Management System and
                        Pong Frenzy, and have had the privilege of working with EJS, Express, MySQL, and Node.js in web
                        development projects like Autheclipse. My goal is to not only master my technical skills but
                        also leverage them to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact. <br><br>

                        In addition to my academic endeavors, I’ve gained practical experience through an internship at
                        the Niraj Singh Foundation, where I contributed to web design and development for an NGO focused
                        on education, sanitation, medical infrastructure, and women empowerment. I am also actively
                        seeking opportunities to grow as a Front-End Developer and Software Engineer. <br><br>

                        While I am an introvert by nature, I enjoy small conversations and connecting with others who
                        share similar interests. Despite having a tendency to overthink at times, I strive to better
                        myself each day, balancing my technical skills with personal growth. I believe in constant
                        learning, adaptability, and embracing new challenges to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech
                        world. <br><br>

                        Beyond coding, I’m also passionate about self-improvement and making progress in various aspects
                        of my life, including physical health, mental well-being, and honing non-technical skills. When
                        I’m not working on coding projects, I enjoy exploring new trends in the tech world, playing
                        games, and learning new tools and technologies. <br><br></p>
