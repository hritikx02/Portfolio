# Portfolio Website  

This is my personal portfolio repository, featuring a dynamic website that highlights my skills, projects, and professional experiences. It includes a fully functional contact form that enables direct communication by sending submissions straight to my email. The design is responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience across all devices, and it incorporates modern web development practices to showcase a polished and interactive portfolio.
